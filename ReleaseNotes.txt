Version: 1.5.2 - 2015-11-28
    * fixed confused ajax-vs-async nomenclature
    
Version: 1.5.1 - 2015-09-21
    * Fixed bug with new rows without default values

Version: 1.5 - 2015-09-15
    * replace update & insert call backs and actions with dbte_save
      that passes an argument array instead of list of arguments.
      should hopefully make upgrading easier (updated example).
      This also allows the callback to set the "id" of the argument
      array (should be passed by ref) in case of insert.
    * async_data: option makes the grid pull data using ajax instead of
      inlining it.  This might make the page appear more responsive if
      the query takes forever. You are probably better off improving
      your query.
    * when calling save ajax, pass all query arguments for the current
      page.  Also set default values along the way
    
Version: 1.4.2 - 2015-08-17
    * bug fixes: new rows were not updating their id
    * saving now submits the currently active cell if there is one
    
Version: 1.4.1 - 2015-06-19
    * added some missing files for translation

Version: 1.3.1 - 2015-03-30
    * Introduce PhpSqlParser and use it instead of my
      half-implemented index scanning, for inserting the where clause

Version: 1.3 - 2015-02-18 10:30
    !! API CHANGE
    * `update_cb`, `delete_cb`, and `dbte_row_updated` all accept ID
      arguments -- TODO: perhaps these should accept keyword arg
      arrays, to make it handle upgrades more gracefully?

Version: 1.2.8 - 2015-02-04 10:30

    * better docs
    * better examples
    * dbte_row_inserted, dbte_row_updated, dbte_row_deleted actions
